<h2>My top 3 movie of all-time.</h2>

<h3>Saving Private Ryan</h3>
<p>
   This movie portrays the devastating consequences of war more clearly than any other film I've ever seen in my life. And I love the quote the captain said: "Earn this. Earn it.‚Äù
</p>

<h3>Shawshank Redemption</h3>
<p>
   It's an absolutely amazing movie with an unexpected and mind-blowing twist ending. Most importantly, it teaches me to always have hope.

<h3>Terminator 2</h3>
<p>
   An outstanding time-travel sci-fi movie! I've watched it at least 20 times.
